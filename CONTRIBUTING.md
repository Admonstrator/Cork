# Contributing Protips
If you want to make your commit messages stand out, you can use my syntax for marking additions/removals/adjustments/etc.
- **+** for **additions**. When you add a new feature or function, mark it with +
- **-** for **removals**. When you remove something, mark it with -
- **^** for **fixes**. When you fix a bug, mark what the bug was with ^
- **~** for **adjustments**. When you change something, but it still works the same, mark it with ~

When you're using this system, you no longer have to say *Removed old parsing function*, you can just write *- Old parsing function*. Or instead of *Fixed infinite loading bug*, you can say *^ Infinite loading bug*.

Of course, you don't have to use this system, but I use it with my commits to reduce their length, so you're welcome to do so, too.
