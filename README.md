A fast GUI for Homebrew written in SwiftUI

# Special Thanks

I'd like to personally thank [Seb Jachec](https://github.com/sebj) for implementing a system for getting real-time outputs of Brew commands. 

Without his contribution, many of the processes that depend on real-time outputs, such as installation, uninstallation and updating of packages, would be impossible.
