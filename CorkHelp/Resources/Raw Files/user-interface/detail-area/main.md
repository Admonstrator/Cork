# Detail Area

The Detail Area has two main states:

- When you do not have any packages or taps opened, it will show the [Status Page](status-page.md).
- When you click one of the packages or taps in the [Sidebar](sidebar.md), it will open in the Detail Area and show you [more information about the selected item](detail-page.md).
